Effect of snow measurement uncertainty on structural reliability
==============

In progress research codes... for collaborative coding, open and reproducible research.

Investigation of the effect of measurement uncertainty on structural reliability. 
After the research has been completed the code will be organized(?) and accompanied with a report or paper.

__Code(s):__ Matlab

__Notes:__ 
* The codes are not cleaned organized in any serious way (yet?). If you have troubles to follow it, contact me.
* It might happen that that not everything is included to run the codes without error. Drop me an email in this case and I will look after it.
* Required programs and scripts:
	* [custom statistical functions](https://github.com/rozsasarpi/Statistics---Matlab)
	* [FERUM](http://www.ifma.fr/FERUM)
